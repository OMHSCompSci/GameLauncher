/**
 * This class is going to be a mostly unchanged class when finished. The point of this is to launch the game. Whenever we update the game, the launcher
 * will check to see available updates, and update when necessary. The update will work by downloading the .class files from some server (Probably firebase storage)
 * and replace the updated files. This shouldn't be extremely difficult I don't think. There is no rush to complete this.
